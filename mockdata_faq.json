        "question": "How to protect yourself from fraud?",
        "answer": "On the one hand, it is advisable to read the seller's reviews before buying. On the other hand, the free, so-called buyer protection helps against fraud. If the purchased item does not match the description or does not arrive at the buyer, he receives the entire purchase price, including shipping costs, back."
